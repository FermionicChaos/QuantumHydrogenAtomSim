-- Alexander Jossart & Mohammed Yousif --
REQUIRES AND NVIDIA GPU TO RUN

Yousif contributed most to the menus and interfaces.
Jossart worked on the simulation graphical and mathematical representations.

This software employs the use of the GNU Scientific Library, SFML, Nvidia's CUDA toolkit,
and several objects created specifically for this use. 

This is a simulation of the quantum version of the Hydrogen atom.
Naturally it is written in 3 energy eigenstates. It took long enough to program these objects.
The priniciples of quantum mechanics has been succesful in explaining many fields of chemistry,
aside from it's bizarre postulates. The electron orbiting an Hydrogen nucleus can be in multiple
energy states at once, according to quantum mechanics. The image of the odd shapes are eigenstates
of the hydrogen atom. In this simulation, it is in more than just one of these.
