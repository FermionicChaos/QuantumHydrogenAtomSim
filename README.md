# Quantum Hydrogen Atom Rendering

This project was written as the final project for ECE 2036. It renders a color cloud of the hydrogen atom. The color
of the cloud corresponds to the phase of the wave function, and the brightness corresponds to the amplitude of the
wave function. Also keep in mind, this was my first programming class in C++. Also with GPU computing. I thought CUDA
sounded very cool at the time and it made my program run at 45 fps. The demo was done on a GTX 660.
